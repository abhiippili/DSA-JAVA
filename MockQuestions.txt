1. Train Arrival And Departures in an array - find out the min platforms required - sorting
2. Find the first positive number that has exactly 4 factors and all the factors a difference d among them 
3. A>B, B>C, C>B meaning a comes first to b, etc - find out the no of possiblities
4. Count the no of subarrays so that the consecutive elements' diff is constant in every subset 
5. Count the no of subsets with a sum divisible by 7 - states are Dp(level, sum % 7) - so that in base case 
only sum % 7 == 0 returns 1
6.Level Order Successor of a Node - do level order, see node removed from the q is matched, break out of the loop, return next node in the q. stop the loop only after adding it's children so that null to the left is handled
